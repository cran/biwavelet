ChangeLog for package biwavelet

changes in version 0.14 (2013-03-06)
added:
  - As of biwavelet version 0.14, the bias-corrected wavelet and
    cross-wavelet spectra are automatically computed and plotted by default
    using the methods described by Liu et al. (2007) and Veleda et al. (2012). 
    This correction is needed because the traditional approach for computing the power
    spectrum (e.g., Torrence and Compo 1998) leads to an artificial and systematic
    reduction in power at lower periods
fixed:
  - Plotting function now accepts traditional plotting flags such as xaxt and yaxt
    to control x and y tickmarks
