ChangeLog for package biwavelet

Changes in biwavelet version 0.17.2 (2014-04-11)
fixed: 
    - Added arguments in plot.biwavelet and phase.plot to control the length
      of the phase arrows and the size of the arrow heads independently.

Changes in biwavelet version 0.17.1 (2013-07-15)
fixed: 
    - Fixed code in check.data to test for constant step size in the data.

Changes in biwavelet version 0.17 (2013-06-05)
added: 
    - Function pwtc can be used to perform partial wavelet coherence between 
      two time series y and x1 by controlling for (or partialling-out) a third 
      time series x2.
 
Changes in biwavelet version 0.16 (2013-05-07)
added:
   - Users can now specify the density of the phase arrows using the plot function.
fixed:
   - Fixed bug in wt affecting the significance region (thanks Patrick Kilduff and Flora Cordoleani)

Changes in biwavelet version 0.15 (2013-04-08)}
added:
   - Users can now specify the color, line width and line type for
     the COI, significance contours and phase arrows using the plot function.
fixed: 
   - Removed misleading examples showing how to compute the 'bias-corrected' wavelet
     coherence. There is no bias for the wavelet coherence function, so using the 
     default type argument in the plot function is recommended.
   - Fixed typos in the documentation of plot.biwavelet and xwt (thanks Lei Cheng) 

Changes in version 0.14 (2013-03-06)
added:
  - As of biwavelet version 0.14, the bias-corrected wavelet and
    cross-wavelet spectra are automatically computed and plotted by default
    using the methods described by Liu et al. (2007) and Veleda et al. (2012). 
    This correction is needed because the traditional approach for computing the power
    spectrum (e.g., Torrence and Compo 1998) leads to an artificial and systematic
    reduction in power at lower periods
fixed:
  - Plotting function now accepts traditional plotting flags such as xaxt and yaxt
    to control x and y tickmarks
